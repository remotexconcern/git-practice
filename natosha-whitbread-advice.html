                <h4>The Start of Something New</h4>
                <p> When starting something new it's easy to get lost in the frey, overwhelmed by concepts you haven't quite grasped and flooded with information. My biggest piece of advice is don't bite off more than you can chew. Keeping a reasonable pace is the key to making sure you only put on your plate what you can handle.</p>

                <p>When you apporach new things with a healthy expectation for yourself is when success really comes. Overloading yourself tends to bring on things like burnout. Burnout is the worst especially when you're doing something new and exciting that's why being realistic with your time and what you can dedicate to learning something new is so important.</p>

                <h4>Don't be shy!</h4>
                <p>I'm lucky enough that i'm surrounded with professionals who work in this exact field and i can get face to face advice on what I'm unsure about but building a community is important. Thankfully there's a skillcrush slack for that. make sure to reach out even if it's uncomfortable at first. </p>
